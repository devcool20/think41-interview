## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Database Queries with JOIN Operations

**1. Departments List Query:**
```sql
SELECT d.id, d.name, COUNT(p.id) as product_count
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN products p ON d.id = p.department_id
GROUP BY d.id, d.name
ORDER BY d.name
```

**2. Department Details Query:**
```sql
SELECT d.id, d.name, d.created_at, d.updated_at, COUNT(p.id) as product_count
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN products p ON d.id = p.department_id
WHERE d.id = ?
GROUP BY d.id, d.name, d.created_at, d.updated_at
```

**3. Department Products Query:**
```sql
SELECT p.*, d.name as department_name 
FROM products p 
LEFT JOIN departments d ON p.department_id = d.id 
WHERE p.department_id = ?
ORDER BY p.id LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
```

### Error Handling

**Implemented Error Cases:**
- âœ… Department not found (404)
- âœ… Invalid department ID (404)
- âœ… No products in department (200 with empty array)
- âœ… Database connection failures (500)
- âœ… Invalid query parameters (handled gracefully)

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "error": "Department not found"
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

- âœ… **200 OK** - Successful responses
- âœ… **404 Not Found** - Invalid department ID
- âœ… **500 Internal Server Error** - Database/server errors

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Coverage
- âœ… All required endpoints tested
- âœ… Response format validation
- âœ… Error handling verification
- âœ… Pagination testing
- âœ… Filtering functionality
- âœ… Edge cases covered

### Test Scenarios
1. **Valid department requests** - All endpoints return correct data
2. **Invalid department IDs** - Proper 404 responses
3. **Empty results** - Correct handling of departments with no products
4. **Pagination** - Limit and offset working correctly
5. **Filtering** - Category and brand filters within departments
6. **Error conditions** - Database failures, invalid parameters

## ðŸ“Š Database Statistics

**Current Data:**
- **Total Departments**: 2 (Men, Women)
- **Total Products**: 29,120
- **Men's Department**: 13,131 products
- **Women's Department**: 15,989 products
- **Data Integrity**: 100% (all products linked to valid departments)
